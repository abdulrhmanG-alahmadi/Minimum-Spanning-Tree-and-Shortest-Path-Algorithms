# Minimum-Spanning-Tree-and-Shortest-Path-Algorithms
This repository contains Java implementations of two fundamental graph algorithms: Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree (MST) and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
